Campfire-Coffee:

The premise of this project is to create a user page and a business page for a coffee company.

The user page needs to be attractive, but the stuff on it at this point just needs to be a placeholder for later functionality and content.

The data page contains a table to summarize the coffee consumption per hour at each store location. It also contains a table of  activity logs for each location that display a randomly generated sample of possible hourly activity in terms of purchases and customers.

The data page also contains a data page with a form to add a new store to the list and update the tables. If a new store is added with the same name as shop that already exists, instead of appending a new store to the end of the activity log table, it just updates the tables that already exist.
